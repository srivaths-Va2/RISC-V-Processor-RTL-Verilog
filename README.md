# Simple RISC-V Processor

The repository is a simple implementation of a RISC-V processor, written in Verilog. 
The processor comprises of multiple components, which include

+ Arithemetic Logic Unit (ALU)
+ Control Unit
+ Datapath Unit
+ Instruction Decoder
+ Instruction Fetch
+ Register files.

# Arithemetic Logic Unit
<p> The ALU takes up two numbers and computes the output of a certain arithemetic or logic operation. The various operations that are supported include-
  
| Left |  Center  | Right |
|:-----|:--------:|------:|
| L0   | **bold** | $1600 |
| L1   |  `code`  |   $12 |
| L2   | _italic_ |    $1 |
