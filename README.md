# Simple RISC-V Processor
The repository is a simple implementation of a RISC-V processor, written in Verilog. 
The processor comprises of multiple components, which include

+ Arithemetic Logic Unit (ALU)
+ Control Unit
+ Datapath Unit
+ Instruction Decoder
+ Instruction Fetch
+ Register files.

## Arithemetic Logic Unit

The ALU takes up two numbers and computes the output of a certain arithemetic or logic operation. The various operations that are supported include-
